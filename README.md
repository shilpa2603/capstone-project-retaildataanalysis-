# capstone-project-retaildataanalysis-
Project analyzes historical sales data from 2010-02-05 to 2012-11-01 for 45 stores located in different regions - each store contains a number of departments

The company  runs several promotional markdown events throughout the year. These markdowns precede prominent holidays, the four largest of which are the Super Bowl, Labor Day, Thanksgiving, and Christmas. The weeks including these holidays are weighted five times higher in the evaluation than non-holiday weeks.

OBJECTIVE

Predict the department-wide sales for each store for the following year

Model the effects of markdowns on holiday weeks

Provide recommended actions based on the insights drawn, with prioritization placed on largest business impact.

The Challenge - One challenge of modeling retail data is the need to make decisions based on limited history. Holidays and select major events come once a year, and so does the chance to see how strategic decisions impacted the bottom line. In addition, markdowns are known to affect sales – the challenge is to predict which departments will be affected and to what extent.
